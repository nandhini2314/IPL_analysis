# IPL_analysis
Data Engineering Process
Using The IPL dataset from the website - https://data.world/raghu543/ipl-data-till-2017 I have done an analysis mainly to practice coding in Apache Spark.
AWS S3 bucket feature has been used to store the big dataset. Then using this bucket I have done the analysis and transformation in DataBricks which provides an environment to run Apache Spark. Then I have used SQL to discover some insights and using matplotlib and seaborn I have done Visualisation.
